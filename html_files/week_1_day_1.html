    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Regular physical activity reduces chronic inflammation by up to 40%, directly impacting your body's inflammatory response. When you exercise, your muscles release anti-inflammatory compounds called myokines, which act like natural medicine throughout your body. Research shows that people who move regularly have significantly lower hs-CRP levels—a key biomarker of systemic inflammation that predicts heart disease, diabetes, and accelerated aging.</p>
    <p>Just 2.5 hours  of moderate activity per week can reduce your biological age by up to 9 years compared to sedentary individuals.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Take a 10-minute walk after your next meal. Notice how you feel before and after—this simple habit can lower post-meal glucose spikes by 30%.</p>
