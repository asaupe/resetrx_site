    <h2>The Hidden Sleep-Sugar Connection</h2>
    <p>What if your sleep quality was secretly controlling your blood sugar?</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Poor sleep doesn't just make you tired—it dramatically affects your HbA1c levels. Studies show that people with poor sleep quality have measurably higher HbA1c levels, even when they eat the same diet as good sleepers.</p>
    <p>Just one night of inadequate sleep can increase morning blood glucose by 20-30%. Over time, chronic poor sleep leads to insulin resistance and elevated HbA1c. But the reverse is also true: improving sleep quality can improve blood sugar control within weeks.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Create a simple "sleep efficiency" routine tonight: dim lights 30 minutes before bed, keep your bedroom cool (65-68°F), and avoid screens. Notice how your morning energy changes with better sleep.</p>
