    <h2>Food as Information</h2>
    <p>Why do some foods make you feel energized while others leave you crashing an hour later?</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Every bite you take sends signals to your cellsâ€”food is information, not just fuel. Your HbA1c and triglyceride levels directly reflect your dietary choices over the past 2-3 months. Foods high in refined sugars and processed carbs create glucose spikes that, over time, lead to insulin resistance and elevated HbA1c.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, whole foods rich in fiber, healthy fats, and lean proteins help stabilize blood sugar and lower triglycerides. Research shows that people following anti-inflammatory eating patterns have 30% lower risk of metabolic dysfunction and maintain healthier biomarker profiles throughout life.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Add one serving of colorful vegetables to your next meal, as your nutrition plan allows. The phytonutrients that create vibrant colors also fight inflammation and support optimal metabolic function.</p>
