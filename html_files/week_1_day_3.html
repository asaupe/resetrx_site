    <p>What if the most powerful anti-aging treatment was completely free and available to you every night?</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Sleep isn't downtimeâ€”it's when your body performs critical maintenance. During deep sleep, your brain clears metabolic waste, your immune system strengthens, and your hormones rebalance. Poor sleep chronically elevates cortisol, your primary stress hormone, which accelerates aging and increases inflammation.</p>
    <p>Studies show that people sleeping less than 6 hours nightly have cortisol levels 50% higher than optimal sleepers. Just one week of sleep deprivation can dysregulate over 700 genes related to immunity, stress response, and metabolism.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Set a phone curfew 1 hour before your target bedtime tonight. Blue light suppresses melatonin production by up to 23%, disrupting your natural sleep-wake cycle.</p>
