    <h2>The Inflammation Detective (hs-CRP)</h2>
    <p>Why your body's fire alarm might be saving your career.</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>hs-CRP isn't just about inflammationâ€”it's your body's early warning system for everything from heart disease to brain fog. At optimal levels (under 1.0 mg/L), this marker correlates with sharper decision-making, better sleep quality, and sustained energy throughout demanding workdays.</p>
    <p>Recent research shows that professionals with lower hs-CRP levels demonstrate measurably better cognitive performance under stress. Exercise is one of the most powerful tools to reduce inflammation, with regular activity lowering hs-CRP levels significantly within weeks.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Start your day with a simple "LIFE routine": 5 minutes of light stretching or movement. This gentle morning activity signals your body to produce anti-inflammatory compounds that last throughout the day.</p>
