    <h2>Your Body's Energy Storage Report</h2>
    <p>The biomarker that responds to change faster than your morning coffee routine.</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Triglycerides are literally stored energy in your bloodstream, and they're the most responsive biomarker to lifestyle changes. High levels (above 150 mg/dL) correlate directly with afternoon brain fog and energy crashes.</p>
    <p>But here's the exciting part: triglycerides can improve dramatically in just 1-2 weeks with the right approachâ€”faster than any other biomarker. Simple changes like eliminating liquid calories, adding omega-3 rich foods, and post-meal walks can produce rapid improvements.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Eliminate sugary drinks for one week (except black coffee and tea). Sugary beverages spike triglycerides more than almost any other food, and this simple change often shows results in days, not months.</p>
