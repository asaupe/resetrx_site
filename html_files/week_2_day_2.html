    <h2>Your Body's Fuel Efficiency Report</h2>
    <p>The three-month energy audit you've been ignoring.</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>HbA1c tells the story of your last three months of blood sugar control. But here's what most people don't know: even non-diabetic variations (between 4.6% and 5.7%) dramatically affect workplace performance and energy levels.</p>
    <p>Each small increase represents higher average blood glucose over time, which directly impacts your ability to focus, make complex decisions, and maintain steady energy throughout the day. The good news? HbA1c responds to lifestyle changes, typically showing improvements within 2-3 months.</p>
    <h3>Think About This:</h3>
    <p>Notice your energy patterns throughout the day. When do you feel most alert? When do you crash? These patterns often correlate with your blood sugar control.</p>
