    <h2>The Traffic System in Your Arteries</h2>
    <p>Why your cholesterol ratio matters more than the headlines.</p>
    <h3>The Science:</h3>
    <p>Think of cholesterol like vehicles on a highway. LDL particles are delivery trucks that can cause traffic jams in your arteries, while HDL particles are like tow trucks clearing the road. The key isn't just your total cholesterolâ€”it's the balance between these types.</p>
    <p>What many people don't realize is that cholesterol can improve relatively quickly with lifestyle changes. Dietary modifications can show results in 4-6 weeks, while exercise effects often appear in 8-12 weeks.</p>
    <h3>Your Action Step:</h3>
    <p>Add one ounce of mixed nuts to your daily routine this week. This simple habit can improve your cholesterol ratio by 5-10% within a month while providing sustained energy for afternoon productivity.</p>
