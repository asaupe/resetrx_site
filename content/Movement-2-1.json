    "closingNote": "<strong>Functional Fitness Philosophy:</strong> These 6 movement patterns aren't gym exercises - they're fundamental human movements you use every day. Squatting is sitting down and standing up. Hinging is picking something off the floor safely. Pushing and pulling open doors and carry groceries. By strengthening these patterns, you're not just building muscle - you're building a body that moves better, feels better, and handles life better. This is fitness with purpose."
