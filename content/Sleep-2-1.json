    "subtitle": "Weeks 1-4: Precision Timing",
    "subtitleDescription": "This phase tightens your sleep schedule from a 30-minute to a 15-minute window and begins the gradual process of extending sleep duration. You'll also establish a more structured evening routine.",
    "video": "Introduction to Functional Training",
    "videoDescription": "Learn the fundamental movement patterns that build true functional strength: squat, hinge, push, pull, carry, and rotate. These movements translate directly to real-life activities and athletic performance.",
    "description":"This program builds upon basic sleep hygiene to create a more robust sleep system. Over 12 weeks, it addresses both sleep duration and quality through structured evening routines, strategic timing of activities, and environmental optimization. The program recognizes that people at this level often have demanding schedules but are ready to prioritize sleep. It emphasizes quality improvements for those who cannot immediately achieve 7-8 hours due to life circumstances.",

    "closingNote": "<strong>Advanced Sleep Science:</strong> Your brain cycles through 90-minute sleep stages (light → deep → REM) 4-6 times per night. Deep sleep (physical recovery) dominates the first half of night, while REM sleep (mental recovery, memory consolidation) dominates the second half. By optimizing your environment and timing, you can maximize both. Elite athletes and performers treat sleep like training - you're now doing the same."
