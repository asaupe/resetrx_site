    "subtitleDescription": "The first month focuses exclusively on sleep timing consistency—the single most impactful change you can make. Before worrying about duration or quality, you'll establish a reliable sleep-wake schedule that works with your life.",

    "videoDescription": "Learn the fundamental movement patterns that build true functional strength: squat, hinge, push, pull, carry, and rotate. These movements translate directly to real-life activities and athletic performance.",
    "description":"This 12-week program focuses on establishing the fundamental building blocks of better sleep. Starting with the most impactful change—consistent sleep timing—it gradually layers in simple habits that don't require dramatic lifestyle changes. The goal is to increase sleep by 20% (reaching 5-6 hours) while significantly improving sleep quality. Each intervention is introduced slowly to ensure sustainable adoption without overwhelming someone who is likely already stressed and sleep-deprived.",

    "closingNote": "<strong>Advanced Sleep Science:</strong> Your brain cycles through 90-minute sleep stages (light → deep → REM) 4-6 times per night. Deep sleep (physical recovery) dominates the first half of night, while REM sleep (mental recovery, memory consolidation) dominates the second half. By optimizing your environment and timing, you can maximize both. Elite athletes and performers treat sleep like training - you're now doing the same."
