    "videoDescription": "Learn the fundamental movement patterns that build true functional strength: squat, hinge, push, pull, carry, and rotate. These movements translate directly to real-life activities and athletic performance.",
    "description":"This advanced program is for those who have good sleep duration but want to maximize sleep quality and consistency. Over 12 weeks, it fine-tunes all aspects of sleep hygiene, addresses subtle disruptors, and implements advanced strategies for deep and REM sleep optimization. The program uses sleep tracking data to make personalized adjustments and focuses on the 10-20% improvements that transform good sleep into excellent sleep.",

Deep sleep (physical recovery) dominates the first half of night, while REM sleep (mental recovery, memory consolidation) dominates the second half. By optimizing your environment and timing, you can maximize both. Elite athletes and performers treat sleep like training - you're now doing the same."
